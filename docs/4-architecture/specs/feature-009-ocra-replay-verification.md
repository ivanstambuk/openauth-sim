# Feature 009 â€“ OCRA Replay & Verification

_Status: Draft_
_Last updated: 2025-10-01_

## Overview
Establish replay and verification workflows that accept operator-supplied one-time passwords (OTPs) and validate them against stored or inline OCRA credentials to support non-repudiation scenarios. This feature focuses on verifying historical OTP submissions rather than regenerating new values, ensuring auditors can confirm whether a claimed OTP was valid under the original credential configuration.
