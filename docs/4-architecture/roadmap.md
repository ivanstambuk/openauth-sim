- Consolidate features logically. I think we have too many and some may be combined. I don't want feature per change, rather feature should be standalone on its own merits.
suggest an approach and give feedback on the idea.
- 2025-11-11 – Renumbering Batch P1 complete: HOTP/TOTP/OCRA work now lives under Features 001/002/003 with their legacy specs preserved under each directory. Proceed to Batch P2 (WebAuthn + EMV/CAP + EUDIW) after verification notes land in `_current-session.md` and docs/migration_plan.md.
- 2025-11-11 – Batch P2 redo: Features 004–006 now host the full WebAuthn, EMV/CAP, and OpenID4VP specs/plans/tasks inline (legacy Feature 024/026/039/040 content copied here 2025-11-11). Legacy directories are queued for deletion after spotless + targeted REST/UI verification, Features 007/008 remain placeholders for the upcoming mdoc/SIOPv2 simulators, and the migrated documentation/quality artifacts now live under `docs/4-architecture/features/010/legacy/007` and `docs/4-architecture/features/010/legacy/008` with Feature 010 owning their specification updates.
- 2025-11-11 – Batch P3 kicked off: Feature 009 now consolidates the operator console scope (legacy Features 017/020/021/025/033–038/041 live under `docs/4-architecture/features/009/legacy/`). Next steps expand the same pattern to Features 010–013 before running the Batch P3 verification gate.
- 2025-11-11 – Batch P3 doc/governance/toolchain migration in flight: Feature 010 now owns documentation & knowledge automation (legacy Features 007/008 archived under its `legacy/` folder), Feature 011 governs AGENTS/runbooks/hooks (legacy 019/032), Feature 012 centralises core cryptography & persistence docs (legacy 002/027/028), and Feature 013 aggregates toolchain + quality automation (legacy 010–015/029/030/031). Roadmap/knowledge-map/session quick reference now cite the refreshed ownership.
- 2025-11-11 – Feature 011–013 cross-cutting sync: AGENTS, runbooks, constitution, analysis gate, knowledge map, architecture graph, and persistence how-to docs now point to `docs/4-architecture/features/011-013/{spec,plan,tasks}.md`, and the governance plan requires logging hook guard + spotless/qualityGate commands in `_current-session.md` and `docs/migration_plan.md`.
- 2025-11-11 – Batch P3 Step 6 (global document sync): Roadmap, knowledge map, AGENTS, session quick reference, runbooks, and the impacted how-to guides now cite Features 009–013 as the canonical owners (operator console, documentation/knowledge automation, governance, persistence, and toolchain). `_current-session.md` and `docs/migration_plan.md` capture the command log while Step 7 (verification sweep) remains queued.
