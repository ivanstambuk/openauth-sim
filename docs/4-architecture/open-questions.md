# Open Questions Log

Use this file to capture outstanding questions or ambiguities before starting work. Limit each feature to a maximum of five high-impact questions per the clarification gate. Each entry should include:

- **Date** the question was raised
- **Context** (feature plan / file / task)
- **Question**
- **Status** (`Open` or `Resolved`)
- **Resolution** (who clarified and when)

| Date | Context | Question | Status | Resolution |
|------|---------|----------|--------|------------|
| 2025-09-27 | Feature Plan 001 / Knowledge Map | Confirm MapDB caching topology (shared vs per facade) | Open |  |

Update entries as soon as the user clarifies them, then mark the row as resolved.
