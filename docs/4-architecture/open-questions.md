# Open Questions Log

Use this file to capture outstanding questions or ambiguities before starting work. Limit each feature to a maximum of five high-impact questions per the clarification gate. Each entry should include:

- **Date** the question was raised
- **Context** (feature plan / file / task)
- **Question**
- **Status** (always `Open`; remove the row once clarified)
- **Resolution target** (note where the answer is documented when you remove the row)
