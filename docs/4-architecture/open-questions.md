# Open Questions Log

Use this file to capture outstanding questions or ambiguities before starting work. Limit each feature to a maximum of five high-impact questions per the clarification gate. Delete a row as soon as its question is resolved and ensure the answer is captured in the referenced spec/plan/ADR before removal. Each entry should include:

- **Date** the question was raised
- **Context** (feature plan / file / task)
- **Question**
- **Status** (always `Open`; remove the row once clarified)
- **Resolution target** (note where the answer is documented when you remove the row)

| Date | Context | Question | Status | Resolution |
|------|---------|----------|--------|------------|
| 2025-09-27 | Feature Plan 001 – Core Credential Domain | What minimum metadata set must the OCRA protocol expose to satisfy emulator scenarios? | Open | Pending – document under spec clarifications once answered |
