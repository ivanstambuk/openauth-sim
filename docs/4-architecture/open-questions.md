# Open Questions Log

Use this file to capture outstanding questions or ambiguities before starting work. Limit each feature to a maximum of five high-impact questions per the clarification gate. Delete a row as soon as its question is resolved and ensure the answer is captured in the referenced spec/plan/ADR before removal. Each entry should include:

- **Date** the question was raised
- **Context** (feature plan / file / task)
- **Question**
- **Status** (always `Open`; remove the row once clarified)
- **Resolution target** (note where the answer is documented when you remove the row)

When communicating options to the user—whether resolving an open question or proposing a general approach—enumerate them alphabetically (A, B, C …), include pros and cons for each, and call out the recommended choice with supporting rationale before requesting a decision.

| Date | Context | Question | Status | Resolution |
| 2025-10-10 | Feature 024 – FIDO2 CLI generator shift | After switching the CLI to the generator service, should we (A) keep the existing `fido2 evaluate` stored/inline commands but return generated assertion payloads, (B) introduce new `fido2 generate` commands while retaining verification-only evaluate flows, or (C) pursue another structure? | Resolved | docs/4-architecture/specs/feature-024-fido2-webauthn-operator-support.md |
| 2025-10-10 | Feature 024 – Operator UI evaluate redesign | When the Evaluate tab becomes an assertion generator, should the result card (A) render a structured JSON `PublicKeyCredential` payload with copy/download helpers, (B) keep the current status/telemetry layout and append assertion blobs beneath it, or (C) adopt another presentation? | Resolved | docs/4-architecture/specs/feature-024-fido2-webauthn-operator-support.md |
| 2025-10-10 | Feature 024 – Sample data private keys | For `Fido2OperatorSampleData`, do we populate presets with (A) compact ES256 JWK private keys only, (B) both JWK and PEM/PKCS#8 formats so operators can choose, or (C) another encoding strategy? | Resolved | docs/4-architecture/specs/feature-024-fido2-webauthn-operator-support.md |
| 2025-10-08 | Workstream 15 – TOTP operator support | Please confirm target wiring order/apis for introducing TOTP evaluation commands/endpoints (CLI + REST) now that the application service exists. Should we mirror HOTP flows directly or stage separate failing tests first? | Resolved | docs/4-architecture/specs/feature-023-totp-operator-support.md |
| 2025-10-08 | Feature 023 – TOTP operator UI parity | What behaviour should the new TOTP “Replay” tab provide so it “works like HOTP and OCRA”: (A) reuse the existing evaluation flow as a read-only replay endpoint, (B) compute and display expected OTP codes for diagnostics, or (C) another interaction model? | Resolved | docs/4-architecture/specs/feature-023-totp-operator-support.md |
| 2025-10-08 | Feature 023 – Operator console TOTP UI | Should the evaluation/replay mode selector display inline parameters before stored credential inputs (mirroring HOTP/OCRA), or maintain the current stored-first layout? | Resolved | docs/4-architecture/specs/feature-023-totp-operator-support.md |
| 2025-10-09 | Proposed Feature – FIDO2/WebAuthn operator support | Should the initial FIDO2/WebAuthn evaluate/replay scope launch the full stack in one feature (core domain, persistence, application services, CLI, REST API, operator UI) or stage facades after the core verification engine lands? | Resolved | docs/4-architecture/specs/feature-024-fido2-webauthn-operator-support.md |
| 2025-10-09 | Proposed Feature – FIDO2/WebAuthn operator support | Do we need both stored-credential and inline assertion evaluation modes (matching HOTP/OCRA) plus a replay-only diagnostics flow, or can we simplify the first release to stored credentials only? | Resolved | docs/4-architecture/specs/feature-024-fido2-webauthn-operator-support.md |
| 2025-10-09 | Proposed Feature – FIDO2/WebAuthn operator support | Which signature algorithms and vector sources are in scope for day-one verification? Options span the provided JSONL bundle (ES256/384/512, RS256, PS256, Ed25519) and the canonical W3C §16 vectors. | Resolved | docs/4-architecture/specs/feature-024-fido2-webauthn-operator-support.md |
| 2025-10-09 | Proposed Feature – FIDO2/WebAuthn operator support | How should we expose the new `Seed sample credentials` control—should it load every vector into persistence, a curated subset, or keep seeds separate from replay-only fixtures? | Resolved | docs/4-architecture/specs/feature-024-fido2-webauthn-operator-support.md |
| 2025-10-09 | Proposed Feature – FIDO2/WebAuthn operator support | Should the “Load a sample vector” buttons on evaluate/replay panels pull from the JSONL bundle, the W3C §16 vectors converted to Base64url, or another curated source? | Resolved | docs/4-architecture/specs/feature-024-fido2-webauthn-operator-support.md |
| 2025-10-10 | Feature 024 – FIDO2/WebAuthn operator support | When we reshape the FIDO2 operator panel to match the HOTP/TOTP/OCRA Evaluate/Replay tab pattern, how should we present the existing sample vector controls so operators can still load JSON fixtures? Options span keeping them inside the inline forms only, exposing them for both stored and inline modes, or omitting them for parity. | Resolved | docs/4-architecture/specs/feature-024-fido2-webauthn-operator-support.md |
| 2025-10-10 | Feature 024 – FIDO2/WebAuthn operator support | Should the Evaluate tab switch from assertion verification to authenticator-style assertion generation (accepting challenge, relying party info, and a private key) with verification workflows confined to Replay, or do we preserve the existing verification flow and add a new generation mode instead? | Resolved | docs/4-architecture/specs/feature-024-fido2-webauthn-operator-support.md |
| 2025-10-10 | Feature 024 – FIDO2/WebAuthn operator support | What format should operators provide the authenticator private key in when generating assertions (e.g., JWK, COSE key, PKCS#8), and do we need to support multiple algorithms beyond ES256 on day one? | Resolved | docs/4-architecture/specs/feature-024-fido2-webauthn-operator-support.md |
