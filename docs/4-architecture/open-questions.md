# Open Questions Log

Use this file to capture every outstanding high- or medium-impact question or ambiguity before starting work. Delete a row as soon as its question is resolved and ensure the answer is captured in the referenced spec/plan/ADR before removal. Each entry should include:

> **Guardrail:** This document may only contain open questions. If you resolve a question, remove its entry from this file immediately (row and any supporting text) after recording the answer in the referenced spec/plan/ADR. Do not keep historical option breakdowns or decisions here; specs and ADRs are the single sources of truth for behaviour and outcomes. Before discussing an ambiguity with the user, add or update the corresponding row so the question lives on disk, then reference the question ID in conversation, restate the options inline (no “go open the file” detours), and keep specs/plans/tasks limited to that ID until it is resolved. Always order options by preference (Option A is the recommended path) and mark the recommendation explicitly so the decision path is obvious to reviewers. When you present a question to a human (for example in chat, specs, or ADRs), format it as a Decision Card using `docs/4-architecture/spec-guidelines/open-questions-format.md` so the A/B/C options and preferred option stay aligned with this table.

- **Date** the question was raised
- **Context** (feature plan / file / task)
- **Question**
- **Status** (always `Open`; remove the row once clarified)
- **Resolution target** (note where the answer is documented when you remove the row)

When communicating options to the user—whether resolving an open question or proposing a general approach—enumerate them alphabetically (A, B, C …), include pros and cons for each, and call out the recommended choice with supporting rationale before requesting a decision.

<!-- Add new rows below with Status set to Open only. Remove the row once resolved. -->
