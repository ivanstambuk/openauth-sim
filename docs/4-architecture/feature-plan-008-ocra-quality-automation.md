# Feature Plan 008 – OCRA Quality Automation

_Status: Draft_
_Last updated: 2025-09-30_

## Objective
Introduce a unified quality gate that enforces module boundaries and mutation/coverage thresholds for the OCRA stack. The gate must run locally and in GitHub Actions, providing clear guidance when regressions arise while keeping build times manageable.

Reference specification: `docs/4-architecture/specs/feature-008-ocra-quality-automation.md`.

## Success Criteria
- ArchUnit (or equivalent) rules detect illegal dependencies between core, persistence, and facade modules.
- PIT mutation testing executes against targeted OCRA packages with an ≥85% mutation score threshold.
- Jacoco coverage thresholds (≥90% line/branch for core OCRA components) enforced in the quality gate.
- `./gradlew qualityGate` aggregates boundary, mutation, coverage, and existing lint checks.
- GitHub Actions workflow runs the same gate on push/PR and blocks merges when thresholds fail.
- Documentation updates explain how to run, interpret, and troubleshoot the gate.

## Proposed Increments
- Q101 – Draft analysis gate notes, update knowledge map references, and ensure open questions cleared for Feature 008. ☑
- Q102 – Author failing ArchUnit tests capturing desired module boundary rules. ☑

- Q126 – Raise CLI facade branches (`OcraCli`, `AbstractOcraCommand`, launcher) with direct helper tests and failure injection. ☑
- Q127 – Extend CLI tests to exercise the `ocra` root command help branch, `emit` formatting edge cases, and `hasText`/`ensureParentDirectory` helpers. ☑
- Q128 – Cover `OcraCli` list/delete failure branches (non-OCRA credential filtering, verbose metadata, exception paths). ☑
- Q129 – Add REST DTO tests validating trim/null handling and defensive copies (`OcraEvaluationRequest`, `OcraEvaluationResponse`, `OcraEvaluationErrorResponse`). ☑

Analysis gate run 2025-09-30 – tooling readiness note recorded below.

### Tooling Readiness – `./gradlew qualityGate`
- Expected runtime: ~8–9 minutes on a 2021 MacBook Pro (Apple M1 Pro, 16 GB RAM) with warm Gradle cache; cold runs may reach 12 minutes.
- Task bundle (subject to confirmation as increments land): `spotlessCheck`, targeted ArchUnit suite under `core-architecture-tests`, `test` for affected modules, `jacocoTestCoverageVerification`, and `pitest` scoped to `io.openauth.sim.core.*` and facade adapters. Mutation phase will run with `--threads=4` and `targetClasses=io.openauth.sim.(core|cli|rest|ui).*` filters tuned per increment.
- Configuration knobs: set `-Ppit.skip=true` to bypass mutation locally when iterating (documentation to clarify when this is acceptable); `-Pquality.maxMinutes` guard will fail the build if runtime exceeds 15 minutes to catch runaway mutation sessions.
- Reports: Jacoco HTML/XML and PIT reports will write to `build/reports/quality/jacoco` and `build/reports/quality/pitest`; Gradle console output will summarise thresholds (Jacoco ≥90% line/branch; PIT ≥85% mutation score).

Document the outcome and proceed only once all boxes are checked.

## Notes
- 2025-09-30 – Q102: Added `core-architecture-tests` Gradle module hosting cross-module ArchUnit checks; `./gradlew :core-architecture-tests:test` (PASS, 8s, configuration cache reused) now guards facade/persistence boundaries.
- 2025-09-30 – Q103: Registered root `architectureTest` lifecycle to run the suite and wired it into `check`; `./gradlew architectureTest` (PASS, 26s) and `./gradlew check` (PASS, 22s) confirm the rules run with dependency locks in place.
- 2025-09-30 – Q104: Introduced aggregated Jacoco report/verification (`jacocoAggregatedReport`, `jacocoCoverageVerification`) with current thresholds line ≥77%, branch ≥62%; `./gradlew jacocoCoverageVerification` (PASS, 9s) and `./gradlew check` (PASS, 6s) confirm wiring. Coverage baseline captured at `build/reports/jacoco/aggregated/`. Follow-up: raise thresholds toward 90% once additional OCRA tests land.
- 2025-09-30 – Q105: Added PIT plugin targeting core OCRA classes with `mutationTest` wiring into `check`; threshold set to ≥85% (current score ≈87.55%, runtime ≈1m26 via `./gradlew mutationTest`). `OcraChallengeFormat` and `OcraCredentialFactory` excluded temporarily pending new tests; follow-up item recorded to expand coverage and re-enable CLI/REST facades.
- 2025-09-30 – Q106: Introduced `qualityGate` aggregate depending on `spotlessCheck` and `check` (which triggers architecture, coverage, mutation suites); baseline runtime ≈1m56 with warm cache, `./gradlew qualityGate -Ppit.skip=true` trims to ≈27s when mutation analysis is explicitly skipped.
- 2025-09-30 – Q107: Updated CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to run `./gradlew --no-daemon qualityGate` on push/PR so GitHub Actions enforces the full boundary/coverage/mutation gate with existing Gradle cache support.
- 2025-09-30 – Q108: Authored `docs/5-operations/quality-gate.md` covering usage, thresholds, report locations, and troubleshooting (includes `-Ppit.skip=true` guidance for local runs).
- 2025-09-30 – Q109: Final gate run `./gradlew clean qualityGate` (PASS, 2s reusing caches) recorded line coverage 77.47%, branch coverage 62.16%, mutation score 87.55%; reports stored under `build/reports/jacoco/aggregated/` and `core/build/reports/pitest/`.
- 2025-09-30 – Follow-up: Coverage baselines (line 77.47%, branch 62.16%) remain below the ≥90% thresholds in the specification; schedule targeted test additions and a threshold review before marking Feature 008 complete.
- 2025-09-30 – Decision: Pursue additional tests (Option A) to raise coverage, keeping thresholds unchanged.
- 2025-09-30 – Q110: Jacoco gap analysis highlights the lowest covered classes — CLI (`OcraCliLauncher` 0%, `OcraCli` 56%, maintenance commands 63–65%), REST (`OcraEvaluationService` 79%, `FailureDetails` 58%, `OcraEvaluationForm` 29%), and core OCRA helpers (`OcraCredentialFactory` 67%, `OcraChallengeFormat` 71%, `OcraResponseCalculator` 85%); prioritise new tests around `OcraCredentialFactory` and `OcraChallengeFormat` to lift core coverage first.
- 2025-09-30 – Q111: Added `OcraChallengeFormatTest` exercising supported/unsupported tokens plus blank handling to close core parsing coverage gaps; next increment targets `OcraCredentialFactory` edge cases.
- 2025-09-30 – Q112: Expanded `OcraCredentialFactoryTest` with negative challenge/session/timestamp scenarios; aggregated coverage now line 80.09%, branch 64.86% (factory-specific 97.44%/72.92%) with remaining deficit driven by CLI/REST helpers.
- 2025-09-30 – Q113: Added `OcraEvaluationServiceTest` covering inline validation and missing session flows; REST service line coverage climbed to 79.67% (branch 69.51%), but overall project remains at line 80.09% / branch 64.86% pending CLI facade tests.
- 2025-09-30 – Q114: Introduced `OcraCliTest` and `OcraCliLauncherTest` to validate inline evaluation flows and launcher usage; CLI coverage rose to 79.49% line / 61.11% branch and aggregate coverage to 81.20% / 65.47%, still below the ≥90% goal.
- 2025-09-30 – Q116: Added `OcraEvaluationFormTest` to exercise inline/credential conversions and secret scrubbing; REST UI form coverage now ≈98.2% line / 90% branch and aggregate coverage reached 85.07% line / 68.32% branch, with remaining gaps dominated by Maintenance CLI and REST controllers.
- 2025-09-30 – Q117: Extended `OcraEvaluationServiceTest` with challenge-format and timestamp-not-permitted scenarios to confirm reason code mapping; REST service coverage now ≈81.9% line / 72% branch though FailureDetails + Maintenance CLI remain below threshold.
- 2025-09-30 – Q118: Added `MaintenanceCliTest` to cover usage, ocra flows, and compact/verify commands; aggregate coverage increased to 85.07% line / 68.32% branch with remaining deficits concentrated in `MaintenanceCli`, REST controllers, and timestamp/session helper records.
- 2025-09-30 – Q119: Added `OcraOperatorUiControllerTest`, `OcraCredentialDirectoryControllerTest`, and `OcraApiApplicationSmokeTest` to exercise REST UI/credential directory endpoints and application bootstrapping; remaining low coverage hotspots are `MaintenanceCli` internals plus `RestApiApplication` metadata (current overall ≈86.51% line / 69.82% branch).
- 2025-09-30 – Coverage audit: `RestApiApplication` ≈33% line (main invocation only), `OcraCli` delete/list commands ≈78–86% with missing not-found + verbose branches, `MaintenanceCli` ≈67% line with failure telemetry paths untested, and `OcraEvaluationService$FailureDetails` ≈82% line with session_not_permitted/timestamp_drift_exceeded mapping still uncovered; increments Q120–Q123 target these gaps ahead of the final gate run.
- 2025-09-30 – Coverage spot-check (post Q123): aggregated ≈86.6% line / 69.8% branch before new work; after Q124 + parser primitives tests, totals sit at ≈89.99% line / 74.77% branch. Remaining deficits: `OcraCli` helpers (branches ~50–80%), `OcraEvaluationService` success metrics, core parser/calculator (`OcraResponseCalculator` 85% line / 69% branch, `OcraSuiteParser` 85% line / 67% branch), and DTO records (`OcraResponse`/`ErrorResponse` branch 50%). Further increments (Q125–Q126) will focus here.
- 2025-09-30 – Q125 plan: Jacoco snapshot (`jacocoAggregatedReport.xml`, 2025-09-30 09:12 UTC) shows `OcraResponseCalculator` at 84.7% line / 69.6% branch and parser/descriptor records at ≤77% branch. Add failing tests covering (A) challenge formatting validation — numeric vs hex vs alphanumeric inputs including client/server concatenation and whitespace trimming, (B) session/timestamp padding and negative counter rejection, and (C) parser token permutations — duplicate PIN declaration, default `S` token padding, numeric/algorithm session tokens, timestamp fallback from crypto segment, and unsupported tokens. Drive these tests green to push core branch coverage ≥90%.
- 2025-09-30 – Q126 plan: CLI coverage gaps remain in `OcraCliLauncher` (75% line / 50% branch) and `OcraCli` helper paths (`AbstractOcraCommand` error handling, import failure telemetry). Introduce tests that (A) capture `System.exit` for non-zero launcher outcomes via a temporary security manager, (B) exercise `failValidation`/`failUnexpected` sanitisation using a stub command with injected writer streams, and (C) trigger import command IO/validation failures (e.g., malformed secret, unwritable database path) to cover both validation and unexpected-error branches while asserting emitted telemetry fields. Target ≥90% branch coverage across the CLI facade.
- 2025-09-30 – Q125 execution: Added `OcraResponseCalculatorEdgeCaseTest` and expanded `OcraSuiteParserTest` with blank/invalid crypto segments, single-sided challenges, session/timestamp validations, and runtime PIN padding. Aggregated coverage now reports `OcraResponseCalculator` 95.5% line / 90.4% branch, `OcraSuiteParser` 100% line / 91.9% branch (Jacoco 2025-09-30 19:58 UTC), and overall totals 91.82% line / 80.03% branch ahead of CLI work. Residual core hotspots: descriptor/persistence helpers (branch 0.50–0.75) slated for follow-up once CLI thresholds land.
- 2025-09-30 – Q126 execution: Added `OcraCliErrorHandlingTest` (validation vs unexpected flows, PIN + drift imports, resolveDescriptor filter) and extended `OcraCliLauncherTest` with a non-zero exit interception. CLI coverage now shows `OcraCliLauncher` 75.0% line / 100% branch, `AbstractOcraCommand` 96.3% line / 100% branch, and `ImportCommand` 100% line / 100% branch. Project aggregate increased to 92.60% line / 81.08% branch (Jacoco 2025-09-30 20:11 UTC), with remaining CLI deficits concentrated in top-level `OcraCli` control flow (~72% branch) and maintenance/delete/list commands (75–80% branch) earmarked for future increments.
- 2025-09-30 – Q132a execution: Added `OcraCredentialDescriptorTest` to cover blank-name rejection, metadata copying, and request metadata defaults. Jacoco now reports 100% line/branch coverage for the descriptor record and request inner class (aggregated report 2025-09-30 22:46 UTC).
- 2025-09-30 – Q132b execution: Expanded `OcraCliTest` to cover list filtering of non-OCRA credentials, verbose metadata omission, missing delete targets, and invalid database telemetry. `OcraCli$ListCommand` now records 100% branch coverage, while `OcraCli$DeleteCommand` holds 75% due to the defensive `IllegalArgumentException` catch remaining untriggered; overall `OcraCli` branch coverage sits at ≈94.4% (Jacoco aggregated report 2025-09-30 22:57 UTC).
- Consider PIT incremental modes and target filters to keep runtime under 10 minutes.
- Evaluate existing GitHub Actions caching (Gradle + PIT) to mitigate CI duration.
- When documenting thresholds, include rationale so future adjustments remain auditable.

Update this plan after each increment and mark complete when Feature 008 ships.
