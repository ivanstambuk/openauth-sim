# Feature 009 Tasks – Operator Console Infrastructure

_Status:_ Complete
_Last updated:_ 2025-11-13

> Keep this checklist aligned with the feature plan increments. Stage tests before implementation, record verification commands beside each task, and prefer bite-sized entries (≤90 minutes).
> When referencing requirements, keep feature IDs (`F-`), non-goal IDs (`N-`), and scenario IDs (`S-<NNN>-`) inside the same parentheses immediately after the task title (omit categories that do not apply).

## Checklist
- _No active tasks._ Populate this section once the next operator-console increment is scoped (≤90 min planned effort each) and reference the governing FR/NFR/Scenario IDs.

## Verification Log
- 2025-11-13 – `./gradlew --no-daemon spotlessApply check` (Implementation Drift Gate verification run)

## Notes / TODOs
- Keep the knowledge map/roadmap aligned with Feature 009 ownership; update references when upstream features change scope.
