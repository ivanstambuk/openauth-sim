# Use the TOTP Operator UI

_Status: Draft_
_Last updated: 2025-10-31_

The operator console embedded in the REST API now exposes TOTP evaluation and replay tooling alongside the existing OCRA and HOTP flows. This guide shows how to validate stored credentials, drive inline checks with custom parameters, replay OTP submissions without mutating counters, and interpret the metadata surfaced by the UI.

## Prerequisites
- Run the REST API locally (`./gradlew :rest-api:bootRun`) so the console is reachable at `http://localhost:8080/ui/console`.
- Ensure the simulator can read the credential store MapDB file (defaults to `data/credentials.db`). TOTP issuance is still out of scope, but the operator console now exposes a **Seed sample credentials** action that loads canonical demo entries into the store. Use the TOTP CLI (`./gradlew :cli:run --args='totp list'`) if you want to inspect or verify the seeded credentials outside the UI.
- Inline evaluation does not require persisted credentials, but you will need the shared secret (hex), algorithm, digit length, time-step, drift window, and OTP you want to verify.
- RFC 6238 validation vectors now ship in `docs/totp_validation_vectors.json`; the simulator loads this catalogue for CLI, REST, and UI presets so the same fixtures remain available across interfaces.

## Enable Verbose Tracing
- The console header now exposes an **Enable verbose tracing for the next request** toggle. Leave it unchecked for the default behaviour; when you enable it, the next evaluation or replay request includes `"verbose": true` so the REST API returns a `trace` payload alongside the standard result.
- Verbose traces contain raw secrets, intermediate buffers, and per-step attributes. The bottom **Verbose trace** dock stays hidden until a verbose response arrives, then expands into a terminal-style panel that shows the operation identifier (for example `totp.evaluate.stored`), ordered steps (`resolve.credential`, `generate.otp`, etc.), and key attributes. Use the **Copy trace** action if you need the raw text for debugging.
- Toggle the checkbox off again when you no longer need deep instrumentation—the dock collapses automatically and subsequent requests omit the verbose flag, preventing sensitive material from surfacing unnecessarily.

## Evaluate a Stored TOTP Credential
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/ui/console?protocol=totp`. The console activates the **TOTP** protocol and selects the **Evaluate** tab with the mode toggle set to **Stored credential**.
2. Select the stored credential from the **Credential** dropdown. If the registry is empty, choose **Seed sample credentials** to load the same SHA-1/SHA-256/SHA-512 presets available in the inline dropdown (covering both 6- and 8-digit variants). You can reseed at any time—the action is idempotent and reports when all canonical entries already exist.
3. Enter the OTP you want to verify plus the timestamp (epoch seconds) that the operator supplied. The **Use current Unix seconds** toggle now auto-fills the timestamp with the console’s current clock quantised to the credential’s step (default 30 seconds) and keeps the field read-only; clear the toggle to supply a manual value and use **Reset to now** to reapply the quantised timestamp.
4. Adjust the **Drift backward** and **Drift forward** fields to reflect the permitted window (defaults to ±1 step). Populate **Timestamp override** if you need to emulate verifier clock skew; the service will evaluate using the override and keep the submission timestamp for telemetry.
5. Choose **Evaluate stored credential**. On success the result panel surfaces the submitted OTP and a status badge (`validated`, `otp_out_of_window`, etc.). Errors appear in the dedicated error panel with sanitized reason codes (for example `credential_not_found` or `otp_out_of_window`).

## Run Inline TOTP Evaluations
1. Switch the mode toggle to **Inline parameters**. The form hides the stored controls and surfaces inputs for the shared secret, algorithm, digits, step size, drift window, timestamp, optional timestamp override, and OTP. A **Load a sample vector** dropdown appears above the form when presets are available. The shared-secret row now includes both **Base32** and **Hex** fields; edits stay in sync so you can paste Base32 data from an `otpauth://` URI and let the console derive the canonical hexadecimal payload automatically.
2. Pick a preset when you want to preload the fields with curated data. RFC 6238-derived samples now cover SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 secrets: the 8-digit presets mirror Appendix B and display the `(RFC 6238)` suffix in the dropdown, while the 6-digit options truncate those reference values and keep a plain label. Another preset mirrors the canonical credential delivered by the **Seed sample credentials** control. Selecting a preset fills in the secret, algorithm, digits, step seconds, drift window, timestamp, and OTP while clearing the timestamp override. Changing any field keeps the preset applied until you manually choose another sample or reset the dropdown.
3. To start from scratch, leave the preset dropdown on the placeholder option and paste the shared secret as either Base32 or hex. Select the hash algorithm (`SHA1`, `SHA256`, or `SHA512`), adjust the digit length (6 or 8) and step duration (seconds) to match the credential under test. Submitting both encodings is rejected with the REST contract’s `shared_secret_conflict` reason code, keeping UI validation aligned with the API.
4. Define acceptable drift by setting the backward and forward step counts. Leave the fields at zero to enforce an exact match window. The inline timestamp field now ships with the **Use current Unix seconds** toggle enabled so it snaps to the active step (default 30 seconds) and stays read-only; clear the toggle to enter a specific epoch value or tap **Reset to now** to refresh the quantised snapshot. Provide a timestamp override if you need to simulate the verifier’s clock, enter the OTP you want to validate, and press **Evaluate inline parameters**.
5. Successful responses render the submitted OTP and status badge; validation failures surface the sanitized reason code and message (for example `otp_out_of_window`) without echoing the shared secret or OTP in telemetry or UI.

## Replay Stored or Inline TOTP Submissions
1. Select the **Replay** tab. The console exposes a replay mode toggle that defaults to **Stored credential** and never mutates simulator state.
2. For stored replays, select the credential from the dropdown and either click **Load sample data** to populate the OTP/timestamp/drift fields with a guaranteed match or enter your own values manually. The timestamp field now exposes a **Use current Unix seconds** toggle (off by default so sample payloads remain intact) plus a **Reset to now** shortcut—enable the toggle when you want to replace the sample timestamp with the console’s current, step-aligned epoch. Adjust the drift window if you want to test looser or stricter tolerance and populate the optional timestamp override when simulating verifier skew. Click **Verify OTP** to receive a `match` or `mismatch` outcome alongside the corresponding reason code; additional metadata remains available through telemetry logs if you need deeper diagnostics.
3. For inline replays, choose **Inline parameters**. Use the **Load a sample vector** dropdown to populate all inline fields with any RFC 6238 sample (8-digit) or derived 6-digit truncation, plus the demo preset, or leave it blank to supply your own data. Provide the shared secret in Base32 or hex along with the configuration (algorithm, digits, step seconds, drift window); the timestamp field now includes a **Use current Unix seconds** toggle (default off) and **Reset to now** action so you can replace preset timestamps with the console’s current, step-aligned epoch when required. Set the optional override if you need to model verifier skew, then press **Verify OTP**. The UI reports whether the OTP would have matched under the supplied conditions.
4. Replay requests emit `rest.totp.replay` telemetry with the same sanitisation guarantees as evaluation—secrets and OTP values are never echoed in the payload.

## Persist Tabs and Modes with Query Parameters
- The console now encodes state with the shared query parameters: `protocol=totp`, `tab=evaluate|replay`, and `mode=inline|stored`. Bookmark links such as `?protocol=totp&tab=replay&mode=stored` to reopen the console in the same configuration; legacy bookmarks containing `totpTab`, `totpMode`, or `totpReplayMode` are still honoured.
- Changing evaluation or replay modes emits `operator:totp-mode-changed` / `operator:totp-replay-mode-changed` events; the surrounding console updates the shared parameters in browser history so back/forward navigation and refreshes preserve your selection.

## Interpreting Metadata and Telemetry
- Stored requests emit `rest.totp.evaluate` telemetry with context fields for algorithm, digit length, step seconds, drift window, matched skew steps, and whether a timestamp override was provided. Telemetry identifiers remain available in server logs; the UI focuses on OTP + status parity with HOTP/OCRA.
- Inline validations emit the same evaluation event but omit credential references and redact the shared secret, OTP, and override timestamp values. When you select an inline preset, the UI still sends the preset key/label so telemetry frames can trace which sample produced the submission. Replay submissions emit `rest.totp.replay` telemetry, adding the credential source and replay outcome (`match`/`mismatch`) without exposing secrets or OTP material.
- Invoking **Load sample data** on the stored replay form emits a `totp.sample` telemetry frame that records the credential identifier, algorithm, digit length, step seconds, drift window, and timestamp provided while keeping secrets and OTP material redacted. The UI surfaces the same sanitized status message shown in the telemetry payload so operators see which preset or note applied.
- Validation errors return `reasonCode` values such as `credential_not_found`, `otp_out_of_window`, or `shared_secret_required`. The UI mirrors these codes in the error panels so operators can triage without inspecting server logs.
- Remember that evaluation and replay requests never mutate persistence—TOTP remains verification-only until issuance lands in a future feature.

Keep this guide updated as TOTP issuance, credential seeding helpers, or replay tooling are introduced in subsequent increments.
