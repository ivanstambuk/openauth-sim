# How-to Guides (Draft)

Document deterministic runbooks for common tasks. Planned topics:

1. Importing credential material via CLI / REST (pending modules).
2. Seeding MapDB stores for integration tests.
3. Running the emulator as a local background service.
4. Upgrading quality tooling and dependency locks.

Each guide should follow the template in `docs/templates/how-to-template.md` (TBD).
