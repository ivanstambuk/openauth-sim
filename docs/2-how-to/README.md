# How-to Guides (Draft)

Document deterministic runbooks for common tasks. Published topics:

1. [Evaluate OCRA challenges via REST](use-ocra-evaluation-endpoint.md)
2. Configuring MapDB persistence profiles (`configure-persistence-profiles.md`).

Planned additions:

- Importing credential material via CLI / REST (pending modules).
- Seeding MapDB stores for integration tests.
- Running the emulator as a local background service.
- Upgrading quality tooling and dependency locks.

Each guide should follow the template in `docs/templates/how-to-template.md` (TBD).
