# Concepts (Draft)

This section will capture core domain concepts:

- Credential taxonomy (FIDO2, OATH/OCRA, EUDI, EMV, custom protocols)
- Secret material lifecycle (ingestion, caching, rotation, archival)
- Threat model and trust boundaries
- Data classification and retention strategy

> TODO: populate once the crypto primitives and protocol flows are modelled in `core`.
