# Operations (Draft)

This section will collect operational playbooks and SRE checklists. Planned content:

- Local environment bootstrap (JDK management, MapDB storage locations).
- Credential store maintenance (compaction, backup, cache warm-up).
- On-call runbooks for REST/API incidents (once services exist).
- Metrics and alerting catalogues.

> TODO: add runbook templates and populate once the REST service is online.
