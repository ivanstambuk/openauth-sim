## Meta
- Date: 2025-10-23
- Primary branch: `main`
- Other active branches: none
- Last green commands: `./gradlew --no-daemon :application:test --tests "io.openauth.sim.application.hotp.HotpEvaluationApplicationServiceVerboseTraceTest"` (2025-10-23), `./gradlew --no-daemon :application:test --tests "io.openauth.sim.application.hotp.HotpReplayApplicationServiceTest"` (2025-10-23), `./gradlew --no-daemon :application:test --tests "io.openauth.sim.application.hotp.HotpReplayApplicationServiceVerboseTraceTest"` (2025-10-23), `./gradlew --no-daemon :cli:test --tests "io.openauth.sim.cli.HotpCliVerboseTraceTest"` (2025-10-23), `./gradlew --no-daemon :rest-api:test --tests "io.openauth.sim.rest.HotpReplayEndpointTest"` (2025-10-23), `OPENAPI_SNAPSHOT_WRITE=true ./gradlew --no-daemon :rest-api:test --tests "io.openauth.sim.rest.OpenApiSnapshotTest"` (2025-10-23), `./gradlew --no-daemon spotlessApply` (2025-10-23), `./gradlew --no-daemon spotlessCheck` (2025-10-23).
- Build status: HOTP evaluation traces now follow the mandated six-step formatter, HOTP replay exposes window search + match derivation across application/CLI/REST/UI, and verbose renderers consume ordered attribute lists. OpenAPI + UI assets refreshed; Selenium suites remain green and tier metadata captured in spec/plan/tasks.
- Quality gate note: Full `./gradlew --no-daemon spotlessApply check` completed successfully on 2025-10-23 with aggregated branch coverage at 70.45 % (1 645/2 335).
- Outstanding git state: OpenAPI JSON/YAML snapshots regenerated with ordered attributes; new `HotpTraceCalculator` helper, replay verbose tests, and prior Feature 034 documentation refresh remain staged awaiting consolidation.

## Workstream Summary
| Workstream | Status | Last Increment | Next Increment | Notes |
|------------|--------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Feature 027 – Unified Credential Store Naming | In progress | T2704 (Documentation refresh and migration guidance) | TBD – Track operator adoption of the unified file; add migration FAQ if support requests surface | Factory/CLI/REST defaults anchored to `credentials.db`; legacy fallback checks removed, docs now instruct manual migration for existing stores. |
| Feature 028 – IDE Warning Remediation | In progress | T2810 (WebAuthn assertion lossy conversion warning) | — | Spec/plan/tasks added, Option B locked, TOTP constructors cleaned, WebAuthn attestation/REST metadata assertions updated; CLI/REST tests assert generated OTPs, Selenium suites verify inline/replay controls, full `spotlessApply check` passes; 2025-10-19 clarifications implemented (DTO extraction + SpotBugs annotation export); rest-api dependency lock refreshed to align `checker-qual` 3.51.1 with Gradle force. |
| Feature 029 – PMD Rule Hardening | In progress | T2903 (Ruleset expansion & baseline) | T2902 – Governance sync & backlog updates | PMD toolVersion bumped to 7.17.0 with dependency locks refreshed via `--write-locks`; legacy `AssignmentInOperand` findings in CLI `MaintenanceCli`, core `CborDecoder`/`SimpleJson`, and core-ocra `OcraReplayVerifierBenchmark` have been refactored and `./gradlew --no-daemon pmdMain pmdTest` now passes; NonExhaustiveSwitch added permanently with green `pmdMain pmdTest` + `spotlessApply check`. |
| Feature 034 – Unified Validation Feedback | In progress | I4 (Spotless/check closure) | I5 – Final review & handoff (if required) | HOTP inline/replay, TOTP replay, WebAuthn inline/attestation, and OCRA evaluate/replay flows now emit ResultCard messaging with Selenium coverage. `docs/2-how-to/use-ocra-operator-ui.md` covers the ResultCard behaviour and `./gradlew --no-daemon spotlessApply check` succeeded on 2025-10-22. |
| Feature 035 – Evaluate & Replay Audit Tracing | In progress | T3522 (HOTP verify trace expansion, 2025-10-23) | T3517 – OCRA trace enrichment; T3518/T3519 – façade formatting + Selenium; T3520 – docs sync | HOTP evaluate traces emit the mandated six-step layout, replay traces log window search + match derivation (now prefixed with `window.range` and `order` headers), CLI/REST/UI printers use `key=value` metadata formatting, and replay responses expose the recommended `nextCounter` even for inline submissions. OpenAPI + UI assets refreshed; next focus is on OCRA coverage and façade/doc follow-ups. |
| _Reminder_ |  |  |  | Keep this table limited to active workstreams; move completed features to the roadmap instead of tracking them here. |
