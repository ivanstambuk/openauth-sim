# Current Session Snapshot

> Keep this file up to date across all active chats. Treat it as the single source of truth for in-progress workstreams so every hand-off is instant. Replace the bracketed text and prune sections you do not need.

- Date: 2025-11-04
- Primary branch: `main`
- Other active branches: none
- Last green commands: `./gradlew --no-daemon :rest-api:test --tests "io.openauth.sim.rest.emv.cap.*"`, `./gradlew --no-daemon :rest-api:test --tests "io.openauth.sim.rest.ui.EmvCapOperatorUiSeleniumTest"`, `OPENAPI_SNAPSHOT_WRITE=true ./gradlew --no-daemon :rest-api:test --tests "io.openauth.sim.rest.OpenApiSnapshotTest"`, `./gradlew --no-daemon :cli:test --tests "io.openauth.sim.cli.EmvCli*"`, `./gradlew --no-daemon :ui:test`, and the full `./gradlew --no-daemon spotlessApply check` (executed 2025-11-04 for T3923 preview window controls).
- Build status: Feature 037 shared-secret polish (T3707) wrapped; Feature 038 remains complete with aligned UI previews and accessibility documentation. Feature 039 now has T3923 (preview window controls across app/REST/CLI/UI) completed; T3924 (verbose diagnostics parity) is the remaining follow-up before acceptance. Feature 029 PMD hardening (T2902) stays in flight as the other active increment (no change this session).
- Handoff note (2025-11-04): Feature 037 remains ready to archive; Feature 038 stays closed after accessibility review, documentation sync, and full quality gate. Feature 039 progresses with T3923 shipping preview window inputs, updated telemetry/contracts, and full test coverage—next pick up T3924 (verbose diagnostic parity). Feature 029 PMD hardening (T2902) remains the parallel focus.
- Clarifications (2025-11-01): EUDIW OpenID4VP simulator scope confirmed—remote OpenID4VP flows only; credential formats include SD-JWT VC plus ISO/IEC 18013-5 mdoc; align with HAIP profile; simulator covers verifier+wallet roles; adopt hybrid fixture strategy (synthetic now, ingest EU conformance vectors when available).
- Latest closure: Feature 039 – EMV/CAP Simulation Services closed 2025-11-02 after stored evaluate parity (UI/REST/CLI), verbose toggle harmonisation, master-key digest redaction, and UI cleanup shipped with a green full Gradle pipeline. Feature 037 – Base32 Inline Secret Support closed 2025-11-01 after dynamic shared-secret messaging shipped and `./gradlew --no-daemon :rest-api:test :ui:test` passed. Feature 026 – FIDO2/WebAuthn Attestation Support accepted 2025-10-31 after trust-anchor summaries were validated and the full Gradle suite reran. Feature 028 – IDE Warning Remediation closed 2025-10-30.
- Quality gate note: Targeted suites remain green – `./gradlew --no-daemon :rest-api:test --tests "io.openauth.sim.rest.ui.EmvCapOperatorUiSeleniumTest"`, `./gradlew --no-daemon :rest-api:test --tests "io.openauth.sim.rest.emv.cap.*"`, `./gradlew --no-daemon :rest-api:test --tests "io.openauth.sim.rest.ui.Fido2OperatorUiSeleniumTest"`, `./gradlew --no-daemon :ui:test`, and the full `./gradlew --no-daemon spotlessApply check` all passed on 2025-11-03 (Jacoco branches 2161/3087 ≈0.7000).
- Commit workflow update (2025-10-25): `githooks/commit-msg` now runs gitlint only; agents must use automated tooling to supply a Conventional Commit message (with a `Spec impact:` body when docs and code change together). `./tools/codex-commit-review.sh` remains the default helper (defaults to `codex exec --model gpt-5-codex --sandbox read-only --skip-git-repo-check --color never`).
- Outstanding git state: Feature 034/035 documentation sync prepared this session (spec/plan/tasks + roadmap + knowledge map); Feature 027 specs/plans/tasks marked complete; Feature 036 tier helper groundwork remains the next focus.

## Workstream Summary
| Workstream | Status | Last Increment | Next Increment | Notes |
|------------|--------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Feature 039 – EMV/CAP Simulation Services | In progress | T3923 – Preview window controls alignment | T3924 – Verbose trace diagnostic parity | T3923 delivered preview offsets across app/REST/CLI/UI (previews, telemetry, OpenAPI, Selenium, CLI JSON/text); verbose diagnostics parity and documentation sync remain before acceptance. |
| Feature 029 – PMD Rule Hardening | In progress | T2903 (Ruleset expansion & baseline) | T2902 – Governance sync & backlog updates | PMD toolVersion bumped to 7.17.0 with dependency locks refreshed via `--write-locks`; legacy `AssignmentInOperand` findings in CLI `MaintenanceCli`, core `CborDecoder`/`SimpleJson`, and core-ocra `OcraReplayVerifierBenchmark` have been refactored and `./gradlew --no-daemon pmdMain pmdTest` now passes; NonExhaustiveSwitch added permanently with green `pmdMain pmdTest` + `spotlessApply check`. |
| Feature 036 – Verbose Trace Tier Controls | Proposed | — | T3601 – Tier helper specification tests (red) | Spec/plan/tasks drafted 2025-10-25 to deliver shared tier helper and cross-protocol tagging; implementation yet to begin. |
| Feature 040 – EUDIW OpenID4VP Simulator | Planning | Specification/plan/tasks refreshed with HAIP-aligned scope | T4001 – Fixture scaffolding & seed setup | Remote OpenID4VP simulator documented (DCQL, SD-JWT VC, mdoc, Trusted Authorities, HAIP encryption) with Evaluate/Replay tabs, inline/stored credential selectors, friendly Trusted Authority labels, ETSI TL/OpenID Federation ingestion, global verbose trace integration, and Generate/Validate flows; hybrid fixture strategy and facade integrations queued behind tests-first increments. |
| _Reminder_ |  |  |  | Keep this table limited to active workstreams; move completed features to the roadmap instead of tracking them here. |
