## Workstream Summary
| Workstream | Status | Last Increment | Next Increment | Notes |
|------------|--------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Feature 026 – FIDO2/WebAuthn Attestation Support | In progress | I2 (core attestation verifier + fixtures landed in commit `feat(core): add WebAuthn attestation verifier stack`) | I3 – Application services & telemetry (stage failing tests, implement services, update telemetry docs) | Trust-anchor optional with self-attested fallback; resolve new doc checklists (`AGENTS.md`, session quick reference) |

## Active TODOs / Blocking Items

- [ ] Update plan/tasks/roadmap/knowledge map once I3 behaviour is implemented and tested.

## Open Questions / Follow-ups
- [ ] None – open questions log currently empty; keep monitoring during I3.
