# Reference (Placeholder)

Auto-generated API, CLI, and schema references will land here once the surfaces exist. Until then, we link to:

- `core` Javadoc (to be generated once APIs stabilise)
- Open standard specifications (FIDO2/WebAuthn, OATH/OCRA, EUDI wallet, EMV) via external links captured in future documentation updates.
