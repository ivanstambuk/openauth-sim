# Decisions

We track significant choices as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). Each ADR is immutable; superseded entries should point at their replacements.

Numbering convention: `ADR-XXXX` where `XXXX` is zero-padded and increments sequentially.

| ADR | Status   | Summary                            |
|-----|----------|------------------------------------|
| [ADR-0001](ADR-0001-core-storage.md) | Accepted | MapDB + Caffeine as the initial credential persistence stack |

## Templates

- `docs/templates/adr-template.md` (to be created) for new ADRs.
- Each ADR documents context, decision, consequences, alternatives, security/privacy, operational impact, and reference links.
